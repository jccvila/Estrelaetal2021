FBA analysis for manuscript entitled 'Nutrient dominance governs the assembly of microbial communities in mixed nutrient environments'

the iJO1366 and iJN1463 metabolic models were downloaded from the BIGGS dataabase. Universe_Bacteria was downloaded from  simply for convenience (taken from CARVEME). It contains the reactions that are added to iJO1366 already formatted in COBRAPy.  Exact reaction stoichiometry can be seen in BIGGS data.base

To run the FBA simulations run FBA_Oxygen.ipynb jupyter notebook

To plot results run Fig4S5.R
